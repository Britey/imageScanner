# imgdupe

Local query-by-image search for large personal image collections.

[中文说明](README.zh.md)

`imgdupe` indexes image files with perceptual hashes, then lets you search by uploading or selecting an example image. It is designed for near-identical visual matches: resized images, recompressed JPEGs, mild blur, small edits, and some cropped variants.

It does **not** delete files. It stores paths, metadata, and hashes in SQLite.

## Features

- Recursive indexing of one or more folders
- Local SQLite index
- pHash, wHash, dHash, SHA-256, and regional grid hashes
- Local web UI for image search
- Upload or paste an image into the web UI
- Search controls for strict/balanced/loose matching
- Optional tryhard crop search
- Optional similar-image grouping and static review pages
- Failure reporting for corrupt or unsupported files

## Installation

Clone the repository, create a virtual environment, then install the package:

```powershell
git clone git@github.com:YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/imageScanner.git
cd imageScanner
py -3.11 -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -e .
```

After installation, the `imgdupe` command should be available:

```powershell
imgdupe --help
```

If the console command is not on your PATH, use the module form from the activated environment:

```powershell
python -m imgdupe.cli --help
```

Both forms require the package dependencies to be installed. Running `python -m imgdupe.cli` from a fresh clone without creating/installing the environment will not work.

## Basic Usage

Index a folder recursively:

```powershell
imgdupe scan "E:\Images" --db images.sqlite --workers 16
```

Then start the web UI:

```powershell
imgdupe serve --db images.sqlite
```

Open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8765
```

The scan command is incremental. Running it again skips unchanged files:

```powershell
imgdupe scan "E:\Images" --db images.sqlite --workers 16
```

You can index multiple roots into the same database:

```powershell
imgdupe scan "E:\Images" "F:\Downloads" --db images.sqlite --workers 16
```

## Web UI

The web UI supports:

- selecting an image file
- pasting an image from the clipboard
- English / Chinese language selection
- strict, balanced, and loose matching
- minimum score
- maximum results
- showing or hiding exact file matches
- tryhard crop search

Tryhard mode can run on a normal index by splitting the query image into many temporary crop and tile variants. It works best with the optional crop index described below.

## Optional Crop Index

The normal index is the recommended default. It is much smaller and works well for near-duplicate search.

If you want stronger cropped-image search, build a larger crop index:

```powershell
imgdupe scan "E:\Images" --db images-crop.sqlite --workers 16 --crop-index
```

This stores many extra crop-region hashes, so the database can become much larger. Use it only when cropped-image recall matters more than index size.

## CLI Search

Search from the command line:

```powershell
imgdupe query "E:\query.jpg" --db images.sqlite --min-score 55
```

Write a simple HTML result page:

```powershell
imgdupe query "E:\query.jpg" --db images.sqlite --html result.html --min-score 55
```

Tryhard cropped search:

```powershell
imgdupe query "E:\cropped.jpg" --db images.sqlite --tryhard --min-score 1
```

## Similar Image Groups

Build groups of visually similar images:

```powershell
imgdupe cluster --db images.sqlite --min-score 70
```

Generate static review pages:

```powershell
imgdupe review --db images.sqlite --out review
```

Open:

```text
review\index.html
```

## Failure Reports

Show files that failed during indexing:

```powershell
imgdupe failures --db images.sqlite
```

The web UI also has a failures page.

## Notes

- Scanning is recursive.
- Original image files are never modified.
- SQLite remains the source of truth for paths, metadata, hashes, matches, and groups.
- Large indexes are expected. A few GB for hundreds of thousands of images can be normal.
- For best scan speed, tune `--workers`; too many workers can hurt performance on slower disks.
